# Heath App
## yarn install
## yarn dev

# Description
- This is my template React 18 
# The structure project
src
|__assets
|__components
|__features
|__models
|__pages
|__routers
|__stores

The project is divided into 3 main parts
|_Pages
|__ features
|___ components

The features section will be responsible for handling all logic and pushing data to components. Components located in the features/<name>/components folder will only receive data via props and render to the interface.

Use basic Typescript to define data types
Use BEM for className
Use mixins for responsive
Use Lazy load component
# Solution 
Step 1: Separate the pages, see which components are difficult to do last.
Step 2: Then build the layouts for the components in the right position
Step 3: Conduct styling for each component
Step 4: Responsive website

## Login 
Only click button login and save token on localstorage
And then navigate to PrivateRouter are '/tops', '/myrecords'
And If not login still access PublicRouter is '/columns'
# DiffChart is the hardest part here.
Because I haven't done much about charts, I have to learn about supporting charts for Reactjs. Then find a suitable chart and customize it as closely as possible.
The chart used is react-chartjs-2
Use faker to dummy data for chart
