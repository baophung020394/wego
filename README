# The structure project

The project is divided into 3 main parts
|\_Pages
|** features
|\_** components

The features section will be responsible for handling all logic and pushing data to components. Components located in the features/<name>/components folder will only receive data via props and render to the interface.

Use basic Typescript to define data types
Use BEM for className
Use mixins for responsive
Use Lazy load component
